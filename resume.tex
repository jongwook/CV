			\begin{cvitems}
				\item \textbf{Analyzing and improving the collaborative filtering algorithms} for music recommendation at iHeartRadio, focusing on the relations between multiple entities using techniques including factorization machines, collective matrix factorization, and hypergraph learning.

		{Jun 2014 - Aug 2015}
		{
			\begin{cvitems}
				\item \textbf{Developed Apache Spark applications for the company's recommender systems} which were gradually being migrated from Apache Hive, and built a framework around Spark called CueSheet, which helps simplify the development cycle of Spark jobs by automating the application packaging and separating the concerns of the implementation and the configuration.
				\item \textbf{Developed a distributed API server in Scala} that delivers personalized recommendations in various domains, which were precomputed and stored in the databases such as HBase and Couchbase. The deployment and scaling was managed using Marathon, and the system supported bucket testing for evaluating different recommendation algorithms on-line.
				\item \textbf{Designed and developed a distributed and fault-tolerant stream processing framework} built atop Apache Kafka, providing stream manipulation primitives such as filter, transformer and joiner for the modular implementation of streaming jobs. Joiner, in particular, leveraged in-memory data grids to combine two input streams which may have arbitrarily ordered data  in real-time.
				\item \textbf{Made a core utility library in Scala} for the API servers and Spark applications being developed in the team, focusing on the simple and thread-safe usage. In addition to the basic IO and JSON conversion utilities, the library enabled easier nonblocking access to various endpoints that the team was using, including ElasticSearch, ZooKeeper, OpenTSDB, HBase, Couchbase, and HTTP servers.
				\item \textbf{Leveraged OpenTSDB and Grafana to record and visualize the real-time statistics} of the various kinds of applications running in the distributed architecture. Using ring buffers, the systems were able to publish real-time metrics without affecting the performance, and they were reflected in the report within seconds, helping quickly identify the trends as well as any unexpected behaviors.
				\item Built and maintained a Jenkins cluster that runs mission-critical Hadoop jobs for the company's recommender systems.

			\begin{cvitems}
				\item \textbf{Designed and developed a distributed server platform} for Lineage Eternal, the company's upcoming massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG).
				The platform was composed of a number of fault-tolerant clusters of Java and C++ servers, built using Netty/RxJava and Boost ASIO for the asynchronous and nonblocking IO.
				Its goal was to make the game playable without requiring the users to select and be limited to only one among many game servers.
				\item Built a cross-platform logging library in C++ that resembles SLF4j, to be used in Lineage Eternal's game servers.
				\item Managed the Perforce source control server, which had millions of files being shared among the team of 100+ members.
